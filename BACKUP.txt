Incremental Backup Utility - Backup Creation Tool


Introduction
    This program is used to create new incremental backups.


Usage
    Backup.exe <source_dir> <target_dir> [<exclude_path1> <exclude_path2> ...]
    
    <source_dir> - The path of the directory to be backed up. May be at least any locally mapped drive (I'm not sure
    how other path types like UNC would work, I haven't tested). If relative, it's taken to be relative to the current
    directory.
    
    <target_dir> - The path of the directory to back up to. Same conditions as <source_dir> apply. It's highly
    recommended that <target_dir> is not contained within <source_dir> (except if you explicitly exclude <target_dir>).
    
    <exclude_path> - 0 or more paths which will never be backed up. If relative paths, they are relative to source_dir.


Process Return Codes
    0 - Backup completed successfully, and no directories or files were skipped due to errors.
    1 - The backup completed successfully, but some directories or files were skipped, or backup metadata could not be
        written, due to filesystem errors.
    2 - The command line arguments are invalid.
    3 - The backup was aborted due to a runtime error, no files were backed up.
    4 - The backup was aborted due to a programmer error (sorry in advance).


Error Handling
    Since this tool performs a lot of file operations, there are many oppurtunities for unavoidable errors to occur.
    In general, this tool tries to back up as much of the source directory as possible, even when errors occur.
    If a directory or file can't be read, it will simply be skipped (this will be logged to the console).
    In very few cases an error may occur that prevents the backup from continuing. In such cases, large amounts of
    files may be skipped (which will also be logged to the console).
    The tool is designed to fail securely. In almost all error cases, the backup shall remain in a consistent, albeit
    perhaps incomplete, state. In the worst error case, some files will be backed up, but metadata for the backup won't
    be written, so the backup won't be used during the next backup.
